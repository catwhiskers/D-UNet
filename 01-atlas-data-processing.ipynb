    "* Throughout the dataset, MRIs are named and sorted based on each cohort (c); each cohort is in the format of cXXXX where XXXX is the number that the cohort was assigned (e.g., c0001). There are 11 total cohorts.\n",
    "* Within each cohort folder are the individual subject(s) folders. Subject folders are named based on the cohort that they are in (cXXXX), the subject number that they were assigned (sXXXX) and the time point at which they were taken (tXX) (e.g., c0001s0004t01). For instance, participants with data taken two weeks apart would have two time points, where t01 is the first time point and t02 is the second. Every image starts with the subject identifier of cXXXXsXXXXtXX.\n"
